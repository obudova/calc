# Calc

Calculator interface as a coding task with integrated @cloudmark/evaluator library.
I am supporting only actions from virtual keyboard from interface. In future want to add normal keyboard events.

Before start run `npm i`.
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
